# Engineering & Everyday Tech Calculator

A versatile, web-based calculator designed for two distinct audiences: engineering professionals/students and everyday users curious about technology. This project started as a simple, single-page site and has evolved into a multi-page application with a clear, user-friendly interface.

## üöÄ Features

This application is split into two main paths, chosen from a card-based landing page:

### 1. Professional Engineering Calculator
* **Organized by Discipline:** Formulas are neatly categorized under Electrical, Hydrology, Civil, and Mechanical Engineering.
* **Dynamic Dropdowns:** Select a discipline to dynamically populate a list of relevant formulas.
* **SI Unit Support:** All calculations are performed using standard SI units (meters, Amps, Pascals, etc.) for accurate, professional results.
* **Clear Formula Output:** Displays the final result along with the formula and values used in the calculation.

### 2. Everyday Tech Calculator
* **User-Friendly Interface:** Uses simple, intuitive cards to select a concept.
* **Solar Power Translator:** Answers practical questions like, "If my solar panels generate 5 kW, how many kettles can I run?" It translates abstract power figures into the number of common household appliances that can be powered.
* **Battery Life Estimator:** Calculates how long a home battery (with a given capacity in kWh) can power a specific appliance (with a given wattage).

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project was built from the ground up using fundamental web technologies, without relying on any external frameworks.

* **HTML5:** For the structure and content of the web pages.
* **CSS3:** For all styling, layout, and responsive design. All styles are managed in a single external `style.css` file for consistency and maintainability.
* **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6):** For all the interactive logic, including dynamic content generation, formula calculations, and user interface manipulation.

## üìÅ File Structure

The project is organized into a clean, multi-page structure to separate concerns and make future development easier.
